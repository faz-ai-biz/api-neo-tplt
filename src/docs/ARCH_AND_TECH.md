# Architecture and Technology Vision

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
- Domain-driven core independent of frameworks
- Dependency flow from outer layers inward
- Business rules isolated from I/O concerns
- Interface-based design for flexibility

### 2. SOLID Design
- Single Responsibility: Each component has one reason to change
- Open/Closed: Extensions without modifications
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable
- Interface Segregation: Focused, cohesive interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

### 3. Scalability Patterns
- Horizontal scaling through stateless design
- Eventual consistency where applicable
- CQRS for complex data operations
- Event-driven architecture for decoupling

## Technical Foundations

### 1. Data Structures
- B-trees for file system operations
- LRU caching for frequent access patterns
- Bloom filters for membership testing
- Consistent hashing for distribution

### 2. Algorithms
- Pagination through cursor-based iteration
- Path traversal with security constraints
- Concurrent access management
- Efficient string matching for searches

### 3. System Design
- Producer/Consumer patterns
- Circuit breakers for failure handling
- Backpressure mechanisms
- Rate limiting and throttling

## Security Architecture

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Input validation at all layers
- Principle of least privilege
- Security by design patterns
- Zero trust architecture

### 2. Data Protection
- At-rest encryption
- In-transit security
- Access control matrices
- Audit logging

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Time Complexity
- O(1) access patterns where possible
- Amortized operations for batching
- Space-time tradeoffs
- Lazy evaluation strategies

### 2. Resource Management
- Connection pooling
- Memory efficient streaming
- Resource cleanup guarantees
- Bounded queue sizes

## Maintainability

### 1. Code Organization
- Hexagonal architecture
- Feature-based structuring
- Interface-first design
- Clear dependency boundaries

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Property-based testing
- Mutation testing
- Fuzz testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Future Extensibility

### 1. Plugin Architecture
- Module system design
- Extension points
- Version compatibility
- Feature toggles

### 2. API Evolution
- Semantic versioning
- Backward compatibility
- Schema evolution
- API deprecation strategy
